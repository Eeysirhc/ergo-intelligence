# Ergo Intelligence

## Objective

Provide a suite of easy-to-use toolkits, guides, and resources for blockchain analysts and data scientists to quickly understand and interface with blockchain data on the Ergo platform.


## Roadmap

This project is focused on the long-term but we can break this down into three primary stages.

### Phase 1: crawl

Create scripts and functions to get this project up and running for our core customers.

### Phase 2: walk

Take everything from Phase 1 and develop robust Ergo blockchain analysis packages and modules.

### Phase 3: run

TBD....webapp perhaps?
